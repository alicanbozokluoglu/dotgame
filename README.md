I confirm that this assignment is my own work.
Where I have referred to academic sources, I have provided in-text citations and included the sources in the final reference list.

## Introduction
This code represents game of the xx using the pygame library. Also, my code uses sys, random, math, os libraries. Code has error handling, file handling and search algorithm. Error handling works with try and expect. File handling works with ring random four amount music in main menu. Music only rings main menu when we open game first time for better focus game. Also, we can find scores in score history with search algorithm. My codes have 30 versions. Last completed version code has 835 lines. My game has main menu, create username and select colour menu, setting menu, score history menu and pause menu. We can change controls in settings menu. Also, we can pause game and we can see score history. Game opens full screen and we can quit game with quit button.
The game consists of us, the enemy, the snake, the stars and the food on the ground. When we eat enemy or food, we earn score. We can be bigger with eat foods. If we eat enemy, enemy will remove after codes will create another enemy and we will be smaller. We can eat enemy if we are bigger than it. If we are smaller than enemy we can eat enemy. If we smash a star, game will be game over. Also, we cannot eat snake but snake eat us game will be game over.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:
- Pygame
- Sys
- Random
- Math
- OS

## Project Structure
- Error Handling: It gives an error message if interpreter cannot detect with use try and expect.
- File Handling: It rings four amounts random music in main menu. It finds music in music file. It only rings in main menu. It rings unlimited in main menu. It starts only when we open game first time.
